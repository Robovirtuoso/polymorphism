'duck_typing'

# ad hoc polymorphism is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic
# functions can be applied to arguments of different types,
# because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct
# and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending
# on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied
